            <h3>Information I Collect</h3>

            <p>
                I may collect the following types of personal information: <br/>
                Email address – used for account verification and important app notifications. <br/>
                Name or username – if applicable, for personalization. <br/>
            </p>

            <h3>How I Use Your Information</h3>

            <p>
                I only use your information for the following reasons: <br/>
                To verify your identity when you sign up or log in. <br/>
                To send you important notifications related to your account or app activity (not marketing). <br/>
                To respond to your support requests. <br/>
            </p>

            <h3>What I Don’t Do</h3>

            <p>
                I don’t sell your data. <br/>
                I don’t share your personal information with third-party advertisers. <br/>
                I don’t send marketing emails or messages. <br/>
                I don’t use tracking pixels or unnecessary analytics. <br/>
            </p>

            <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>

            <p>Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption and best practices. While no system is 100% foolproof, I do my best to protect your information and only keep it for as long as necessary to support your use of the apps.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

            <p>If the app uses any third-party services (like email providers, cloud storage, or crash reporting tools), they are only chosen if they have strong privacy policies and practices. These services only receive the minimal data necessary to perform their function. </p>

            <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>

            <p>
                You have the right to: <br/>
                Access the data I have about you <br/>
                Request corrections or deletion <br/>
                Withdraw consent (where applicable) <br/>
                To make any of these requests, just contact me directly: <a class="text-violet-600" href="mailto:oivesowen@gmail.com">oivesowen@gmail.com</a> <br/>
            </p>

            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

            <p>If I make changes to this policy, I’ll let you know in the apps or via email (if it’s something important). </p>

            <h3>Contact</h3>
